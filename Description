🌐 GlobalPress CMS - AWS Architecture Deep Dive
1. 🎯 Introduction
The GlobalPress CMS architecture is a classic example of a highly available, scalable, and secure 3-tier web application on AWS. It is designed to withstand AZ failures, handle global traffic efficiently, and integrate securely with on-premises infrastructure.

2. 🔧 Detailed Component Breakdown
🌐 VPC Network Layer:
VPC Foundation: /16 VPC, logically segmented into public and private subnets across two AZs

Public Subnets: Routes to an Internet Gateway for public internet access

Private Subnets: Outbound traffic through NAT Gateways in public subnets, maintaining privacy while allowing updates and AWS service access

🖥️ Web/Application Tier:
EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Enables scaling out during load and scaling in during quiet periods

Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Layer 7) with health checks

💾 Data Tier:
Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ: Primary database with synchronous replication to standby replica

Amazon ElastiCache: Redis/Memcached cluster for caching database queries

🔄 Decoupling & Async Processing (Req #8):
Amazon SQS Queue: Handles tasks like image processing and email sending

Worker EC2 Instances/Lambda: Process messages from SQS queue at their own pace

⚡ Global Acceleration (Req #6):
Amazon CloudFront: Caches static assets at Edge Locations worldwide

Origin Setup: ALB or EC2 instances serve as origin for dynamic content

🔒 Security Deep Dive:
Layered Security Model:

Network ACLs: Stateless subnet-level defense

Security Groups: Stateful instance-level firewalls

IAM Roles: Secure access without stored credentials

AWS Shield Standard: DDoS protection

AWS WAF: Filters malicious web traffic (SQLi, XSS)

🌉 Hybrid Connectivity (Req #11):
AWS Direct Connect: Dedicated private connection to corporate data center

VPN Backup: Encrypted internet-based backup connection
